## Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to my Lung Cancer Prediction project! 🌬️🔍

In this repository, I've developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on a set of features including age, smoking habits, allergies, and more. Leveraging powerful algorithms and data-driven insights, this project aims to contribute to early detection and improved diagnostics in the realm of healthcare.

### Highlights:

- 📊 **Data Analysis:** Explored and analyzed a diverse dataset to understand the relationships between different attributes and lung cancer occurrence.
- ⚙️ **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented state-of-the-art machine learning models, including Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to predict lung cancer with high accuracy.
- 📈 **Accurate Predictions:** Achieved an impressive accuracy score of [insert accuracy score]% on the validation dataset, showcasing the model's potential in healthcare applications.
- 🩺 **Healthcare Impact:** Demonstrates how technology and data science can play a pivotal role in aiding doctors and patients with early diagnosis and informed decision-making.

Feel free to explore the code, data preprocessing techniques, model implementation, and results in this repository. If you have any questions or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you. Let's work together towards a healthier future! 🌐🏥
